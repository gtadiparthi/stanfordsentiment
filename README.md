# stanfordsentiment

Contains all the classes that I wrote to use the Stanford Sentiment Analyzer.

Many of the classes have been used for scoring the sentiments of the debate data that I have been working on.

* Run ProcessCSV.java to score the sentiments of text

* Sentiment.java is the wrapper class findSentiment and findSentimentInt are methods that return sentiment text and sentiment integer, respectively

* first.java can be used for testing various sentences and understanding how the model scores

* TreePrintout.java prints the entire parse tree of the sentence
